  "Portable byte primitives for the CAR wire format.

  CAR is a byte format, not a data format: every offset a range read depends
  on is a count of bytes in one specific encoding. So this namespace is
  deliberately narrow and total — it does the four things the format needs
  (concatenate, slice, read a little-endian integer, read an unsigned varint)
  and refuses the cases where JVM and JavaScript would disagree instead of
  picking one silently.

  The refusal that matters is `u64`: JavaScript numbers are exact only below
  2^53, and a CAR offset past that would encode as a different integer on the
  two runtimes. The format allows it; this library does not, and says so."

  Every fixed-width read below goes through this, and the reason is a

  JavaScript `aget` yields `undefined`, so `read-u32-le` returns `NaN` on
  ClojureScript -- and `NaN` fails every comparison silently: a loop written
  `(= i n)` against a `NaN` count never ends, and `(> v max-safe-integer)`
  is false for `NaN`, so even this namespace's own range guard passes it
  through. Measured 2026-09-06 on nbb, a truncated CARv2 index decoded that
  way did not terminate and did not yield the event loop.
