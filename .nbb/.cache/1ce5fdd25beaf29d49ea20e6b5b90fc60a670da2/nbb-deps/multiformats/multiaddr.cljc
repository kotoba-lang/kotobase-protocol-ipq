(ns multiformats.multiaddr
  "Multiaddr — self-describing network addresses (multiformats.io/multiaddr).

  `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001/p2p/QmPeer` instead of `127.0.0.1:4001`. The
  difference is not cosmetic and it is the reason libp2p uses them: a
  `host:port` string is only meaningful if you *already know* what protocol is
  meant, so the knowledge lives outside the value and every layer that touches
  it has to be told again. A multiaddr carries that knowledge inside itself, so
  a value can be passed to something that has never heard of QUIC and still be
  parsed, stored and compared correctly.

  ## The binary form is the identity

  A multiaddr has a human string form and a binary form, and the **binary** one
  is canonical: `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001` is one specific octet sequence, and
  two addresses are the same address when their octets match. Comparing the
  strings instead makes `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/04001` a different address from
  `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001`, and lets a peer be entered twice in a routing
  table under two spellings of one address.

  So `parse` normalizes through the binary form, and `equal?` compares octets.

  ## Protocol codes are the wire

  Each component is `<varint protocol-code><value>`. The codes come from the
  multicodec table and are not ours to choose — `/tcp` is 6 and will always be
  6. Sizes are fixed for some protocols (ip4 is 4 octets, tcp is 2), zero for
  flags like `/quic`, and length-prefixed for variable ones like `/p2p`.
  Getting a size wrong does not fail loudly: it consumes the wrong number of
  octets and reinterprets everything after it as a different address."
