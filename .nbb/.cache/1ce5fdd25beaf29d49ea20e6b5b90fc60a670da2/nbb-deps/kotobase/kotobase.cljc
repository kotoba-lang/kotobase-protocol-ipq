(ns kotobase.kotobase
  "KotobaseStore — the IStore that persists to **kotobase.net** (the kotoba PDS).
  It carries NO HTTP client: every op is forwarded through a host-injected `xrpc`
  function `(fn [method params] -> result)`. The injecting host wires `xrpc` to the
  kotoba XRPC endpoint — in a Cloudflare Worker that is a `fetch` to
  `https://kotobase.net/xrpc/<method>` carrying the actor's CACAO; in tests it is a
  mock over a LocalStore. So the same store record runs in a worker, a JVM service,
  or a WASM pod.

  The five methods map onto kotoba's `:db-api` verbs (`{:q :transact! :pull …}`):
  `:put`/`:append` are `transact!`-class writes to the actor's key-derived IPNS
  graph (depth-1 self-mint, no token), `:get`/`:list`/`:read` are `q`/`pull` reads.
  kotobase.net itself backs that graph onto external object storage (git-annex/B2,
  S3) — so 'kotoba external storage' is exactly this record pointed at the PDS."
