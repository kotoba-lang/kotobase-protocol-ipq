(ns kotobase.code-graph-async
  "Promise/completion-aware facade over the complete synchronous code-graph API.

  `run!` materializes the code graph through an IStore whose methods may return
  host async values, runs any existing `kotobase.code-graph` operation against a
  LocalStore, then flushes only its document and append deltas. Thus callers do
  not need an async duplicate of every code-graph function and the admission,
  verification, disclosure, merge, retention, and execution logic keeps one
  implementation.

  Use `promise-runtime` in ClojureScript. Tests and synchronous hosts can use
  `immediate-runtime`; other hosts may inject the same resolve/then/all algebra."
