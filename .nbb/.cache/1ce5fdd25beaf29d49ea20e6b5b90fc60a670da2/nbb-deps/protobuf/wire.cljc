(ns protobuf.wire
  "Protocol Buffers **wire format** (protobuf.dev, \"Encoding\") — encode and
  decode, schema-driven, in portable `.cljc` with no dependencies and no code
  generation.

  Deliberately *only* the wire format. There is no `.proto` parser, no
  descriptor set, no generated classes. A schema here is an ordinary EDN map
  from field number to a small descriptor:

      {1 {:name :value    :type :bytes}
       5 {:name :sequence :type :uint64}
       9 {:name :data     :type :bytes}}

  That is enough for the two things this workspace needs protobuf for — IPNS
  records and Kademlia DHT messages — and it keeps the schema reviewable next
  to the spec it came from rather than hidden in generated output.

  ## Unknown fields are preserved, byte-for-byte

  The rule that makes or breaks this library. Protobuf is designed so a reader
  can skip fields it does not know, and every real deployment relies on it: a
  record written by a newer Kubo carries fields this schema has never heard of.

  A decoder that drops them and an encoder that cannot put them back means a
  record **cannot round-trip** — and for a *signed* record that is not a
  compatibility inconvenience, it is a validation failure. The signature covers
  bytes that no longer exist. So `decode` keeps unknown fields as raw
  `{:field-number [wire-type octets]}` under `:protobuf/unknown`, and `encode`
  re-emits them in field-number order alongside the known ones.

  This is the same lesson as `dnssec.canonical`: what breaks is never the
  arithmetic, it is that two sides serialized the same value differently.

  ## Encoding is deterministic

  The spec permits fields in any order and does not require a canonical form.
  This library always emits ascending field number, and never emits an absent
  or default-valued optional field. Determinism is not aesthetic here — a
  signature is over bytes, and \"the same message\" has to mean the same
  octets on every host and every run."

;; The fields this workspace encodes — an IPNS sequence number, a TTL in
;; nanoseconds, a Kademlia cluster level — stay far inside that, and a library
;; that reached for BigInt would be non-portable (`bigint` is JVM-only) or
;; goog.math.Long (CLJS-only) for a range nothing here uses. If a caller ever
;; needs the top eleven bits of a uint64, this is the place that has to change,

  "Base-128 varint, little-endian groups, high bit as continuation.

  Negative values encode as their two's-complement 64-bit pattern, which is why
  a negative `int32` takes ten octets on the wire — a protobuf quirk rather
  than a bug here. `sint32`/`sint64` exist precisely to avoid it and go through
  `zigzag` first.

  **A negative value is refused**, on both hosts, and this is a deliberate
  limitation rather than an oversight. Encoding one requires the full unsigned
  64-bit pattern (ten groups); decoding one requires a value above
  `Long/MAX_VALUE` on the JVM and above 2^53 on ClojureScript. Supporting it
  would mean a big-integer path on both sides for a case no schema here has —
  IPNS and Kademlia are `uint64`, `bytes` and `enum` throughout — and a
  half-supported signed path is worse than none, because it would encode on one
  host and fail to decode on the other. `sint32`/`sint64` carry signed values
  correctly through `zigzag` and cost one octet for small negatives.

  `decode-varint` refuses past nine groups for the same reason, so the two
  directions agree about exactly which values exist."
