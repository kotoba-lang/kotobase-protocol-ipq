  "IPQ/1 — bounded, verifiable selection over HTTP.

  A trustless gateway answers *give me this CID*. This surface answers *run
  this traversal and give me the blocks that prove the result*, which is the
  operation kotobase's query plane actually performs and the one it had no way
  to offer or to advertise.

  ## What a 200 from here means, exactly

  The body is a CARv1 containing the blocks a bounded IPLD selector touched,
  root first. Every one of them was rehashed before it was decoded, and the
  caller can replay the same selector against the archive alone
  (`ipld.car.trustless/replay-selection`) and reach the same matches without
  trusting this server.

  It does NOT mean the answer is complete. Replay proves that a named traversal
  ran over verified bytes; proving that a database range or a Datalog answer
  omits nothing needs authenticated index boundaries, which do not exist yet
  (kotobase ADR-2609060000). The profile number in the descriptor is where that
  distinction is recorded, and it is why this is IPQ/1 and not IPQ.

  ## Why a separate path, not `?selector=` on /ipfs/

  kotobase ADR-2609060000: *An arbitrary `?selector=` endpoint returning CARv2
  is a custom protocol, not automatically a standard trustless gateway.
  Negotiate supported forms and versions explicitly.* Overloading `/ipfs/`
  would make a non-standard response indistinguishable from a standard one to
  a client that guessed wrong. `/ipq/v1/` says which protocol answered.

  The rest of that sentence is `accepts-car?` and `ipni`: a form this surface
  cannot produce is refused rather than answered with a CAR, and the descriptor
  states the protocol identifier an index handed the client, so arriving at the
  right address and arriving at the right protocol stop being two separate
  acts of faith.

  ## Surface

      GET  /ipq/v1                         profile, limits, encodings, identity
      GET  /ipq/v1/selection/{root-cid}?selector=<base64url dag-cbor>
      HEAD likewise

  Handlers are pure: `(handle ctx req) -> resp`, over the block port injected
  in `ctx` as `:blocks {:get (fn [cid] -> block | nil)}` — required, see
  `block-port`. No network I/O, no host JSON, no crypto dependency."

(def ipni
  "The IPNI identity of this protocol, restated on the surface it identifies.

  An index hands a client two things — a multicodec protocol identifier and an
  address — and no promise that they belong together. Before this block a
  client could decode `transport-ipq-selection-http` out of an advertisement,
  follow the address, and find nothing at the other end that named the protocol
  back; the only confirmation available was to send a selection and see whether
  the answer looked like one. The descriptor now says which identifier this
  surface answers for, which is the half of that handshake the surface owns.

  The code looks unregistered because it is. `0x300940` sits in the multicodec
  PRIVATE USE AREA (`0x300000`-`0x3FFFFF`, \"reserved for internal use by
  applications\"), offset by `0x0940` — the next free slot in the registered
  transport family (`0x0900` bitswap, `0x0910` graphsync, `0x0920`
  ipfs-gateway-http, `0x0930` filecoin-piece-http) and therefore the code a
  registration would ask for. Announcing an unregistered code OUTSIDE that
  range would be squatting on a registry we do not own; announcing one inside
  it is what the range is for, and a reader who does not know the code learns
  that it is application-private rather than that the advertisement is
  malformed. Both numbers are published because only one of them is on the
  wire, and a client that saw `0x300940` and no explanation would have to guess
  which registry it came from.

  `metadata` is hex, and it is the framing an advertisement carries:
  `uvarint(protocol) ++ uvarint(payload-length) ++ payload`. `ipq` is this
  protocol's entry alone — length one, payload the profile number.
  `advertised` is the whole Metadata field kotobase publishes, the trustless
  gateway entry `a01200` first because `0x0920 < 0x300940` and the spec asks
  for increasing protocol order.

  AUTHORITY: `ipni.metadata` in kotoba-lang/io-ipni-specs — `ipq-selection-http`,
  `ipq-selection-http-registration-request`, `ipq-selection-http-bytes` and
  `kotobase-metadata-bytes`, where that framing was measured against go-libipni
  v0.8.2 rather than read off IPNI.md's prose (the prose omits the length, and
  the reference rejects what the prose describes). io-ipni-specs is NOT a
  dependency here and must not become one: this is a pure handler with three
  deps, and it advertises nothing — publishing is the deploy shell's business.
  Two independent statements of one wire constant is the intended arrangement.
  An undeclared drift between them is not, which is what `ipq_test.cljc` pins."

  `ipld.dag-json/base64-decode` is standard-alphabet and throws on any

  translation happens HERE rather than by handing it the raw parameter: `-`
  and `_` are legal base64url and illegal base64, so passing them straight
  through would reject a correctly-encoded selector, and stripping unknown
  characters instead would decode a corrupted one into different bytes without
  saying so.

  Returns this runtime's byte container, or `{:error reason}`. Padding is
  optional; base64url normally omits it and both forms mean the same thing.

  The `as-bytes` at the end is not tidying. `base64-decode` returns a Clojure
  VECTOR of numbers, and the CBOR reader downstream measures its input with
  `.length` -- which on a vector is `undefined`, so the decoder sees zero bytes
  and reports `cbor: unexpected end of input`. The bytes were correct and the
  container was not, and the two are indistinguishable from a value comparison:
  measured while writing this, a round-trip test comparing `(vec decoded)` to

  asks for supported forms *and versions* to be negotiated explicitly, and a
  concrete type we cannot produce is now a 406.

  Absent or empty is served. RFC 9110 gives a request with no `Accept` the
  whole space of representations, and a field that is present and empty ranks
  nothing — there is no type in it to refuse.

  Specificity is honoured rather than any-match, and that is the whole reason
  this is a fold and not a `some`. `application/vnd.ipld.car;q=0, */*` means
  *anything but a CAR*; an any-match reading finds `*/*`, serves the CAR, and
  gets the client's one instruction exactly backwards. RFC 9110 ranks an exact
  type above `type/*` above `*/*`, so the qvalue that decides is the one on the
